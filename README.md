# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to provide an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast 
2. Get a complete list of cadidates who received votes 
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote 

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv 
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Challenge Summary 
This script can me modified for different future purposes by having it run multiple tasks to get a deeper understanding if someone was a campaign manager for a candidate. The additional code that was performed in the challenge to get voter turnout and county results could be helpful to properly allocate resources where turnout is low and demographics are hard to reach. We can modify the code to analyze age, sex and ethnicity to help candidates understand who they need to appeal to more. 
This script could also be modified to use on a larger scale election, and change counties to states. 
This script and modifications can be used by campaign managers to help a candidate win future elections.
